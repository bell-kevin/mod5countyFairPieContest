This exercise demonstrates your competency in the skills learned in this module. You must complete this exercise on your own, without any help from an instructor or another student. If you get stuck, go back through the relevant sections in the book, the quizzes, and the assignments for this module -- everything you need to do in this exercise has been covered in this and previous modules.

These are skills you practiced in this and previous modules and will now demonstrate:

Creating and using arrays
Creating and using 2D arrays
Sorting arrays
Searching arrays
Creating and using vectors
Writing and using structures
Writing and using classes
Writing and using functions
Passing parameters to functions
Returning values from functions
Using loops
Reading input and writing output
 

Module 5 Competency Project: County Fair Pie Contest

Create a project that determines the winners at the county fair Pie Contest. The project will use an array to store the names of the contestants, the scores given to each contestant's pie by 3 judges, and the average of those scores. Then the project will sort the array in descending order of the average score, and display the names of the top 3 contestants to award them gold, silver or bronze medals.

The array may hold structures or class objects, your choice. You will get the data for the array in this fileDownload this file. Read it in and fill the elements of the struct or object in the array. Each line in the file holds the contestant's first and last name, and 3 scores stored as doubles. You will need to calculate the average of those 3 scores to complete filling out each contestant's struct or object when you read the data into the array. 

Sort the array using either a bubble sort of an insertion sort, your choice, in descending order of the averages, so the contestant with the highest average is listed first, the next highest average is listed second, and so on. Display the result of this sort to show all information, then display the names of the gold, silver, and bronze medalists. Be sure to use output manipulations to make the display look like tables, as shown below, and to always display the decimal point and 2 decimal places.

Take a screenshot of the result. It should look like this:

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
